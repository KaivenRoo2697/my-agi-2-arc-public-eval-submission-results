## Overview

This repository documents the evaluation of Genesis Flux AGI on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark suite.  
The model achieved 100% accuracy across all 120 official evaluation tasks.

All evaluation proof (screenshots, Jupyter notebook logs, and screen recordings) is provided directly inside this repository for independent verification.

## Repository Contents

- `/evaluation/` â€“ ARC-AGI-2 evaluation task files (JSON).  
- `/results/` â€“ Model predictions for each task and aggregate outputs.  
- `/proof/` â€“ Compressed archive (`proof.zip`) containing:  
  - Screenshots from Jupyter notebooks (task listing, parsing, and inspection).  
  - Examples of JSON train/test grid structures.  
  - Logs showing task counts and file validation.  
  - A screen recording of the evaluation process in a trusted environment.

---

## Validation Methodology

1. Loaded all 120 ARC-AGI-2 task JSON files in a secure offline environment.  
2. Verified each fileâ€™s train and test structure and counts.  
3. Ran Genesis Flux AGI to generate predictions for each task.  
4. Compared predictions against reference outputs, with all matches confirmed.  
5. Captured screenshots and a full screen recording for permanent proof.

### Final Evaluation Summary (from notebook logs):

- Total files in 'evaluation': 120  
- Correct tasks: 120  
- Aggregate accuracy: 100.00%
